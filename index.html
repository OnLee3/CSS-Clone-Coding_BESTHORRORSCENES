          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror, and all
          have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.

                >You know that thing where you want to revisit a favorite from
                childhood, but you’re a little hesitant because you don’t know
                how it’ll hold up and you don’t want to sully the fond memories?
                While Coma is a pretty lightweight little thriller that smacks
                hard of 1978 in virtually every way, it’s still a really
                compelling story with some pretty unforgettable imagery and
                heart-pounding sequences. File under: good movies for plane
                rides so nearby passengers don’t have to see decapitated heads
                or disembodied hands murdering scantily-clad teens.</span
